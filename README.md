# Business Processing and Modeling Notation (BPMN) Knowledge Graph Rendering Engine
 
This repository is hosts software code for producing OWL2 knowledge graphs using the [BPMN-based Ontology](https://github.com/AminaANNANE/BBO_BPMNbasedOntology). The software engine reads an Excel spreadsheet of a BPMN process model and generates an OWL2-encoded artifact that represents the process model.  This "rendering engine" is written in Java 17 using NetBeans and will be updated periodically.
